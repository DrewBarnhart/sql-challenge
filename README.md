# Sql-Challenge

I utilized  provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Then using quick DBD created a map of the files/ diagram of the data. Within this i assigned the primary and foreign keys. 

After this, I copied the code generated from the QuickDBD to create my tables. Lastly I imported the files into SQL so my tables would be complete. 

### created code to:
find several lists *NOTE: displayed columns are just a portion of total results of the data output*

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
